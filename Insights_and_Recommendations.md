## Insights Generated from the Analysis:

The insights generated were established using pivot tables, correlation analysis and analytical thinking. 

1. **The total units of oil produced by Brass is more than what Ekeremor and Southern Ijaw produced combined.**
   
**Likely Reasons for Disparity in units produced**:The top 2 performers, Brass and Nembe
- on average had lower quality issues;
- received more training hours; and
- Staff invested the most work hours including overtime  hours into production.

2. **Training is important as it likely impacts the quantity and quality of products produced. More products are produced, cost is saved whilst quality issues are reduced when training is provided to staff.**

3. **Brass and Nembe have the highest productivity levels as they have the highest units produced per hour and the lowest cost per unit. Also they always outperform the Company’s weekly average for both measurements.**

4. **Ekermor and Southern has the lowest productivity levels as they produce lower than the Company’s average weekly and their costs is always higher than the weekly average in comparison to others.**

5. **Quality issues in all the branches keeps increasing weekly, including Brass and Nembe who are the Top 2 performing rig locations with the lowest Quality Rate**.

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a43beead-2388-457e-9697-fbd1ecb2f657)

- Brass has the lowest Quality Rate at **0.0041**, whilst Ekeremor has the highest Quality Rate at **0.0082**.

6. **The more hours are worked and overtime hours put in by an employee, the more units of oil they are likely able to produce. However, these increased hours likely have a negative impact as the quality issues and production costs increases or likely to increase. Quality issues has an impact on production costs, where quality issues increases so does production costs and vice versa.**

7. **Generally in the Company, Production Costs is likely impacted by the total units and units produced per hour. As units increases so does production cost and vice versa.**

8. **Although units produced likely impacts production costs. Ekeremor and Southern Ijaw are incurring costs which is almost 40% higher than the top 2 performing Rig locations, despite producing the least units per hour and total units.**

    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2d141b2-b99b-4c2b-8949-c7d2cf12d69c)

- This suggests these rig location may have system issues that may be causing them to under perform and generate such high cost such as machine failures, employees not performing optimally, ineffective training etc.

## Recommendations

- Provide better training and development opportunities to all staff to reduce quality issues, increase units produced and save costs. Every staff should undertake at least 2 hours training weekly. However, Ekeremor and Southern Ijaw's training programme should be tailored to help them improve their productivity and reduce their quality issues.
  
- Investigate the common quality issues complaints, fix them and train staff on how to avoid those issues in the future, whilst also ensuring compliance.
  
- Investigate and identify likely causes of low productivity in Ekeremor and Southern Ijaw such as machine issues, unconducive working condition, staff motivation etc.
  
- Introduce proactive equipment maintenance practice and condition monitoring to minimize unplanned downtime, maximize uptime and also save costs.

- Reasonably increase staff work hours in Ekeremor and Southern Ijaw after providing adequate training to increase production, reduce costs and quality issues.

- Branch Managers in Ekeremor and Southern Ijaw  should ensure their branch staff are carrying out their duties during work hours so they are able to ramp up production and save costs.
